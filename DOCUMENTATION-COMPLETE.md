   - Updated all examples to highlight TypeScript benefits
   - Documented best practices for type inference
   - Fixed documentation examples to use type-safe transition patterns

3. **Enhanced Examples**
   - **Toggle**: Simple on/off state machine
   - **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Game with clear states and transitions (replaced counter)
   - **Traffic Light**: Sequential state machine with timing
   - **Form Validation**: Reusable form machine factory pattern
   - **Stopwatch**: Time tracking with complex state
   - **Auth Flow**: Complete authentication flow
   - **Checkout Flow**: Multiple coordinated machines (auth + checkout + payment)

4. **Improved Guides**
   - **Quickstart**: Simplified getting started experience
   - **State Machines**: Comprehensive introduction to core concepts

   - **React Integration**: More practical examples for React users

5. **Reusable Patterns**
   - Documented factory patterns for creating reusable machines
   - Added examples of machine coordination
   - Showcased form validation patterns
   - Demonstrated multi-machine workflows

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Visual Diagrams**: Add state transition diagrams for complex examples
2. **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of all documentation for consistency and correctness

## Conclusion

The documentation is now substantially complete, providing a comprehensive reference for Matchina users. The examples cover a wide range of use cases from simple toggles to complex multi-machine workflows, demonstrating Matchina's flexibility and power.

The TypeScript-first approach ensures users can leverage the full power of the type system for safer, more maintainable code. Each guide and example now follows a consistent structure that builds knowledge progressively.
