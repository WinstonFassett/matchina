# Matchina Project Analysis

## Overview

Matchina is a lightweight, strongly-typed toolkit for building and extending state machines, factories, and async flows in TypeScript. It follows a modular philosophy with nano-sized, opt-in primitives inspired by libraries like Timsy, XState, and Andre Sitnik's nano library style.

## Test Coverage Summary

The project has good test coverage (78.48% statements overall) with some areas needing improvement:

- High coverage (90%+):
  - Core functionality like factory-machine, matchbox, states, match-case
  - Base implementations of state machines

- Areas needing coverage improvement:
  - factory-machine-hooks.ts (21.47%)
  - matchina.ts (25.58%)
  - promise-handle.ts (12.9%)
  - state-machine-transition-helpers.ts (25.64%)

## Documentation Organization Issues

1. **Example Structure**:
   - Examples are numerous but lack clear organization
   - Mixed console and React examples without clear distinction
   - Some examples may be too complex for initial understanding

2. **Documentation Flow**:
   - Concepts aren't clearly introduced in a progressive manner
   - Difficulty distinguishing basic vs. advanced concepts

3. **Documentation Content**:
   - Home page doesn't showcase features effectively
   - Code examples could be broken up more for clarity
   - Type guard documentation is incomplete

## Next Steps For Improvement

1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Focus on improving low-coverage areas
   - Clean up console logging in tests
   - Consider converting some documentation examples to tests

2. **Documentation Restructuring**:
   - Move features to home page for better visibility
   - Create clear progression from basic to advanced concepts
   - Break up large code examples into smaller, focused pieces
   - Distinguish between React and console examples

3. **Example Organization**:
   - Add introductory text to examples
   - Group examples by concept and complexity
   - Consider removing or refactoring complex examples

4. **Type System**:
   - Complete documentation of type guards
   - Review and improve API for extensions

5. **Publishing Cleanup**:
   - Ensure examples aren't included in npm package
   - Review dependencies for both root and docs
