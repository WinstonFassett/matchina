# Hierarchical Machines R2 Code Review

## Overview

This branch (`hierarchical-machine-dx`) builds upon the hierarchical-machines work to improve developer experience while preserving core enhancements. The branch attempts to add definitions and flattening capabilities but shows signs of being a "long road and kind of a mess" as noted in the task description.

**New Files Added:**
- `src/definition-types.ts` (122 lines) - Type definitions for hierarchical flattening
- `src/definitions.ts` (327 lines) - Runtime implementation of definition and flattening logic  
- `test/definitions.test.ts` (404 lines) - Tests for definition APIs
- `test/flatten.api.types.ts` (208 lines) - Type-level tests requiring explicit casting
- `test/flatten.types.ts` (92 lines) - Type utility tests

- `playground/propagateSubmachines.ts` - Enhanced validation and error handling (86 line change)

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Incomplete Implementation - Major Red Flag** üö®

The core `flattenMachineDefinition()` function is essentially a stub:

```typescript
// src/definitions.ts:294-326
export function flattenMachineDefinition<...>(
  def: MachineDefinition<SF, T, I>,
  opts?: FlattenOptions  
): FlattenedMachineDefinition<SF, T> {
  // Extract raw structure from factory
  const rawStates = extractRawFromFactory(def.states);
  // ... 
  // Return with properly typed structure
  return {
    states: flattenedFactory as FlattenedStateMatchboxFactory<SF>,
    transitions: flattened.transitions as unknown as FlattenedFactoryTransitions<SF, T>,
    initial: flattened.initial as FlattenFactoryStateKeys<SF>,
  };
}
```

While the function exists and has tests that pass, it relies heavily on type assertions (`as unknown as`, `as any`) which bypass TypeScript's safety guarantees. This is fundamentally broken.

### 2. **Type Inference Failure - Core Problem** üö®

The type system cannot automatically infer submachine types from runtime objects:

```typescript
// test/flatten.api.types.ts:21-29 - Requires explicit casting
const Parent = defineMachine(
  defineStates({
    Broken: undefined,
    Working: Child as { machine: typeof Child }, // EXPLICIT CAST REQUIRED
  }),
  // ...
);
```

Without explicit typing, TypeScript infers `string | number | symbol` for state keys - essentially useless.

### 3. **Schizophrenic API Design** ‚ùå

The codebase has two competing approaches:
1. **Definition-first (intended)**: Static submachine definitions with flattening
2. **Instanceful (legacy)**: Runtime child machines with propagation

This creates confusion and duplicated concepts. The design document acknowledges this but doesn't resolve it.

### 4. **Overly Complex Type Machinery** ‚ùå

`src/definition-types.ts` contains intricate conditional types that don't work due to runtime type erasure:

```typescript
// Complex but ineffective type gymnastics
export type FlattenedFactoryStateSpecs<F, Delim = "."> = {
  [K in Extract<FlattenFactoryStateKeys<F>, keyof F>]: F[K];
} & {
  [K in Exclude<FlattenFactoryStateKeys<F>, keyof F>]: 
    K extends `${infer Parent}${Delim}${infer Child}`
      ? Parent extends keyof F
        ? ExtractMachineFromFactory<F[Parent]> extends MachineDefinition<infer SF, any, any>
          ? Child extends keyof SF
            ? SF[Child]
            : any  // Falls back to any
          : any
        : any
      : any;
};
```

This complexity provides no practical benefit due to type erasure at runtime.

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. **Hackish Runtime Type Detection** ‚ùå

```typescript
// src/definitions.ts:276-290 - Fragile function string inspection
const funcStr = creator.toString();
if (funcStr.includes('machine') || funcStr.includes('defineSubmachine')) {
  // Assume it's a submachine - create a dummy object
  raw[key] = { machine: { states: {}, transitions: {}, initial: '' } };
}
```

This approach is brittle, unreliable, and will break with code minification.

### 2. **Incomplete Error Handling** ‚ùå

```typescript
// src/definitions.ts:230-248 - Basic collision handling
if (opts.eventCollision === "error") {
  throw new Error(
    `Event collision for "${ev}" from "${fromLeaf}": collision handling for functions not implemented`
  );
}
```

Error messages acknowledge that functionality isn't implemented.

### 3. **Excessive Test Duplication** ‚ùå

- `test/definitions.test.ts` (404 lines) - Comprehensive but overlapping tests
- `test/flatten.api.types.ts` (208 lines) - Type tests requiring manual casts
- `test/hsm.duck-child.test.ts` (279 lines) - Duck-typed tests overlapping with existing HSM tests
- Existing HSM tests still present and passing

Many test concepts are repeated across multiple files testing similar hierarchical behavior.

## Positive Aspects

### 1. **Clear Documentation** ‚úÖ

The documentation is thorough and honest about limitations:
- `HIERARCHICAL_MACHINES_R2_DESIGN.md` provides clear API specification
- `FlatteningDefinitions.md` explains the technical challenges well
- Progress notes show awareness of the problems

### 2. **Backward Compatibility** ‚úÖ

Existing code using `defineStates` continues to work. The new APIs are additive.

### 3. **Solid Core Logic** ‚úÖ

The `flattenFromRaw()` function (lines 111-221 in definitions.ts) correctly handles:
- State key prefixing (`"Parent.Child"` format)
- Event propagation and collision detection
- Initial state cascading
- Parent-level transitions retargeting

### 4. **Working Examples** ‚úÖ

The traffic light flattening example demonstrates the intended behavior works when properly set up.

## Specific Cruft and Duplication

### Files That Should Be Removed/Consolidated:

1. **`test/flatten.api.types.ts`** - 208 lines of tests requiring explicit casts indicate fundamental API failure
2. **`test/hsm.duck-child.test.ts`** - 279 lines duplicating existing HSM functionality  
3. **`BUG.md`** - 65 lines of development notes, not production documentation
4. **`HIERARCHICAL_MACHINES_PROGRESS.md`** - Development scratch notes

### Code Duplication:

1. **Definition Functions**: Multiple ways to create machines (`defineMachine`, `createMachine`, `createMachineFrom`, `createMachineFromFlat`)
2. **Type Utilities**: Complex type manipulation in `definition-types.ts` duplicates simpler approaches
3. **Test Coverage**: HSM behavior tested in multiple overlapping test files

## Dependencies and Core Changes

### Factory Machine Types Change ‚úÖ

The change to `src/factory-machine-types.ts` is minimal and correct:

```typescript
// Added NormalizeParams type to fix event parameter inference
type NormalizeParams<P> = [P] extends [never] ? [] : P extends any[] ? P : [];
```

This is a legitimate fix, not cruft.

### Propagate Submachines Enhancement ‚úÖ

Changes to `playground/propagateSubmachines.ts` add proper validation and error handling. The enhanced validation is good:

```typescript
const isValidMachine = typeof m?.getState === "function" && 
  (typeof m?.send === "function" || typeof m?.dispatch === "function");
```

## Test Coverage Status

Running `npm test` shows **149 tests passing** with no failures and **97.51% overall coverage**:

```
Test Files  33 passed (33)
Tests      149 passed (149)
Coverage   97.51% statements, 93.79% branches, 96.92% functions
```

Key coverage details:
- **Core functionality**: 98.14% coverage in `src/`
- **New definitions.ts**: 85.84% coverage (some experimental paths uncovered)
- **HSM playground**: 86.06% coverage (some edge cases uncovered)

However, coverage quality concerns:
1. Many tests pass due to type assertions bypassing safety (`as unknown as`)
2. Definition/flattening tests work but require explicit casting in complex cases
3. Some test duplication across multiple HSM test files, but with unique scenarios

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Cleanup Phase) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

1. **Remove Failing API Attempts** ‚úÖ:
   - ~~Delete `test/flatten.api.types.ts`~~ (already removed - tests requiring explicit casts indicate API failure)
   - ~~Delete `test/hsm.duck-child.test.ts`~~ (already removed - duplicated existing HSM coverage)
   - ~~Delete development notes: `BUG.md`, `HIERARCHICAL_MACHINES_PROGRESS.md`~~ (already cleaned up)

2. **Mark Experimental Features** ‚úÖ:
   - Added clear warnings that flattening APIs are experimental
   - `flattenMachineDefinition()` now has "‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL" warning with reference to documentation
   - `defineSubmachine()` marked as experimental with appropriate caveats

3. **Preserve Working Tests**:
   - Kept useful type tests in `test/flatten.types.ts` (tests type-level behavior) 
   - Maintained working flattening demo in `test/hsm.flattened.traffic-light.test.ts`
   - Preserved comprehensive API tests in `test/definitions.test.ts` (14 tests passing)

### Strategic Direction

The fundamental challenge is TypeScript's runtime type erasure. The current approach cannot succeed without major architectural changes. Consider:

1. **Accept explicit typing** - Require users to explicitly type submachine references
2. **Build-time code generation** - Generate types at compile time (complex tooling)
3. **Abandon compile-time flattening** - Make flattening runtime-only with simpler APIs

The hierarchical machines functionality itself (propagation, nesting) works well. The definition/flattening layer adds complexity without solving the core type inference problem.
