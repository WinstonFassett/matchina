# Documentation Reorganization Complete

This document summarizes the reorganization of the Matchina documentation.

## Guides Completed

1. **index.mdx** - Rewritten to better showcase features, TypeScript focus, and navigation
2. **quickstart.mdx** - Updated with clearer structure, step-by-step example, and next steps
3. **union-machines.mdx** - Rewritten to focus on Matchbox as a foundational tagged union pattern
4. **machines.mdx** - Rewritten to cover creation, transitions, usage, advanced patterns, and examples
5. **promises.mdx** - Expanded to explain promise machines, states, usage, hooks, and examples
6. **effects.mdx** - Rewritten to explain effect states, handlers, exhaustive handling, and benefits
7. **lifecycle.mdx** - Rewritten to cover all lifecycle hooks, setup, event structure
8. **typeguards.mdx** - Rewritten to explain `.is()`, `.as()`, `.match()`, advanced filters
9. **integrations.mdx** - Rewritten to provide comprehensive React integration guide
10. **context.mdx** - Rewritten to explain state context, accessing data, transforming during transitions
11. **hooks.mdx** - Rewritten to explain hook types, transition lifecycle, cleanup functions

## Examples Created

1. **toggle.mdx** - Basic on/off toggle state machine
2. **counter.mdx** - Counter with increment, decrement, and reset
3. **traffic-light.mdx** - Traffic light with automatic transitions
4. **form.mdx** - Form with validation state machine (refactored to use a reusable form machine factory)
5. **stopwatch.mdx** - Stopwatch with start, stop, reset functionality
6. **auth-flow.mdx** - Complete authentication flow
7. **checkout.mdx** - Advanced checkout flow with multiple coordinated state machines (auth + checkout + payment)

## Key Improvements

1. **TypeScript Integration** - All examples now highlight TypeScript benefits
2. **Practical Examples** - Added more real-world, practical examples
3. **Improved Structure** - Consistent structure across all guides and examples
4. **Progressive Learning** - Content builds from simple to advanced
5. **React Integration** - Added more React-specific examples and best practices
6. **Documentation Navigation** - Added "Next Steps" sections to guide users

## Still To Do

1. Review existing examples in the /examples directory and ensure they match the new documentation structure
2. Add diagrams for state transitions where mentioned in the docs plan

The documentation now provides a clear, structured learning path for users of Matchina, highlighting its TypeScript-first approach and practical applications.
