# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --status in_progress
bd update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync with git remote
bd sync
```

### For AI Agents

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL
```

## How It Works

- Issues are stored in a local SQLite database (`.beads/beads.db`)
- The database is gitignored - it's rebuilt from JSONL on clone
- `issues.jsonl` and `metadata.json` are the git-tracked source of truth
- Run `bd sync` to sync between database and JSONL files
