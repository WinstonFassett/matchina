# TypeScript Inference Fixes - Complete

This document outlines the changes made to fix TypeScript inference issues in the Matchina documentation.

## Problem Statement

The previous documentation defined states and transitions as standalone objects, which breaks TypeScript inference. Standalone definitions prevent proper type checking, autocomplete, and validation, making it harder for users to catch errors at compile time.

## Solution Summary

We've updated the documentation to consistently use the recommended approach for maintaining full TypeScript inference:

1. **Inline definition of transitions**: Transitions are now defined inline within the `matchina` function call across all examples.
2. **Using `matchbox` for state definitions**: We continue to use `matchbox` for state definitions as it preserves type inference.
3. **New dedicated guide**: Added a comprehensive guide on TypeScript inference best practices.
4. **Updated examples**: All examples now follow the recommended patterns.

## Changes Made

### New Content

- Created a new guide: `docs/src/content/docs/guides/typescript-inference.mdx`
  - Explains the problem with standalone definitions
  - Demonstrates recommended patterns
  - Provides comparison examples
  - Explains developer experience benefits

### Updated Examples

Updated all example files to use inline transition definitions:

- `toggle.mdx`
- `counter.mdx`
- `traffic-light.mdx`
- `form.mdx`
- `stopwatch.mdx`
- `auth-flow.mdx`

### Updated Guides

- Updated `quickstart.mdx` to:
  - Use inline transitions in the traffic light example
  - Add a dedicated section on TypeScript inference best practices
  - Link to the new TypeScript inference guide

### Navigation

- Updated `astro.config.mjs` to include the new TypeScript inference guide in the sidebar navigation

## Benefits for Users

These changes ensure that users:

1. Learn the proper way to define state machines from the beginning
2. Understand the benefits and importance of maintaining TypeScript inference
3. Have a clear reference for best practices
4. See consistent examples throughout the documentation
5. Get better IDE support (autocomplete, validation) when following the documentation

## Next Steps

- Consider adding compiler-enforced patterns to the library itself that would warn users when they use standalone definitions
- Add unit tests that verify type inference is working as expected
- Consider adding linting rules specific to Matchina usage
