- [ ] Matchbox State Factories
- [ ] State Factory Machines
- [ ] Transitions
- [ ] Promises
- [ ] Lifecycle and Hooks
  - [ ] simplify lifecycle example
  - [ ] Move type safety everywhere to features
- [ ] examples need structure, intro
- [ ] enumerate the type guards: is, as, 

## Type guards and matching
- matchChange
- getFilter
- isEntry
- State = is, as, match
- transition hook extensions - share API?

## Extensibility approach in ext, which is kinda weird
- extensionware, funcware, abortable

## Examples

- promise simple example is not simple
- review context example. does it make sense?

## 5. NPM Publishing

## 6. General Cleanup
