# TODO (Blocking)

- [ ] Document child.exit heuristic and addressable children usage with `withSubstates(..., { id })`.
- [ ] Add README examples for checkout flow and duck-typed child routing using `routedFacade`.
- [ ] Optional: add debug tracing utility for routing/exits behind a dev flag.

# TODO (Nice-to-have)

- [ ] Consider explicit `final: true` opt-in to avoid heuristic ambiguity for exits.
