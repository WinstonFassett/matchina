# Matchina: Project Finalization Plan

## Priority Tasks

### Documentation Improvements

- [ ] Implement new documentation structure according to DOCS-PLAN.md
- [ ] Move features to home page for better visibility
- [ ] Break up large code examples into smaller, focused pieces
- [ ] Distinguish between React and non-React examples
- [ ] Add visual state diagrams for complex machines

### Code Cleanup

- [ ] Clean up console logging in tests for readability
- [ ] Standardize logging format in examples and tests
- [ ] Review and improve test coverage for:
  - [ ] factory-machine-hooks.ts (21.47%)
  - [ ] matchina.ts (25.58%)
  - [ ] promise-handle.ts (12.9%)
  - [ ] state-machine-transition-helpers.ts (25.64%)

### Type System Enhancements

- [ ] Complete documentation of type guards:
  - [ ] is, as, match functions
  - [ ] matchChange
  - [ ] getFilter
  - [ ] isEntry
- [ ] Review and improve API for extensions

### Publishing Preparation

- [ ] Ensure examples aren't included in npm package
- [ ] Audit dependencies for both root and docs
- [ ] Prepare release notes for v0.1.0

## Documentation Sections to Improve

- [ ] **Matchbox State Factories**: Clarify usage patterns and benefits
- [ ] **State Factory Machines**: Show type inference benefits
- [ ] **Transitions**: Add more examples of complex transitions
- [ ] **Promises**: Simplify promise examples for better clarity
- [ ] **Lifecycle and Hooks**: Simplify lifecycle example, show real-world use cases
- [ ] **Type Guards**: Create comprehensive guide to all type guards

## Example Improvements

- [ ] Simplify promise examples for better onboarding
- [ ] Review context example for clarity and usefulness
- [ ] Ensure all examples are properly structured with:
  - [ ] Clear introduction
  - [ ] Step-by-step explanation
  - [ ] TypeScript benefits highlighted
  - [ ] Next steps for learning more

## Technical Improvements

- [ ] Consider upgrading dependencies:
  - [ ] Astro, shikiji for documentation
  - [ ] Test libraries for better coverage reporting
- [ ] Review and document the extensibility approach in ext folder
- [ ] Evaluate experimental features for promotion or deprecation
