# Intro by me, the actual SWE

I had to prune this so the numbers are off.

I need you to understand this library in order to fucking help. 

The whole idea is that Matchbox Factories created by `matchboxFactory` provide excellent type support for parameterized tagged unions with typed payloads. And that is very useful for state machines. 

Fundamentally this lib provides matchboxFactory() to create matchbox factories and functions to create state machines. defineStates is a matchboxFactory wrapper that always uses the `key` property for the discriminator. createMachine(states, transitions) is very strongly typed utility function that, given typed state matchboxFactory, can provide excellent typig for transitions that define entry and exit states and can also have functional overrides for typed events that carry typed data payloads. The machines are implemented internally by createTransitionMachine which actually satisfies the StateMachine interface but is itself agnostic of how to create states. For machines, we provide createApi(machine), zen(machine) and facade(machine) which can create more convenient wrappers for interacting with machines and sending events by calling methods. And we provide a ton of extensibility mechanisms that basically override the core methods of the inner state/transition machine. We haven't even gotten into the ext stuff and we don't really need to yet imo as it is sort of implementation detail. But we provide hooks and lifecycle mechanisms that are very strongly typed. Basically with this lib you should never have to use TS to cast any types in order to access strong typed payloads. Code ends up looking pretty clean imo in terms of type declarations. 

Technically "MatchboxFactory" is not a thing. So it's a confusing title imo. There is only a function, `matchboxFactory` which might be called createMatchboxFactory(). Anyway the doc title MatchboxFactory is weird. Would be better to call it Matchbox Factories, with a space.

The ordering of the docs sucks and i think copilot has not been good so far at taking a holistic view and emphasizing good quality organization, flow, content length and readability. I think copilot errs on the side of making things too long. but at this point I think it's lost the plot. Hence this restart. It is idiotic to put the matchbox factory stuff at the end of the guide section when it is the foundational thing for the lib. Absurd. Review the docs, think about how the flow ought to work at a high level. 

I want to see a quickstart, but then after that we talk about matchbox factories, then states and createMachine. And then use a sort of core -> non-core progression. MatchboxFactory and Matchbox (Tagged Union) are duplicative. there was supposed to be an interestig thing about how to implement a state machine using matchboxes for states and events, but I think copilot fucked it up. 

I am looking for better sidebar groupings. Guides is kinda dumb IMO. what is idiomatic? Is it "guides" and "examples"? nothing else?.

# Documentation Analysis and Status

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the current state of Matchina's documentation, outlines recent improvements, and identifies remaining work needed to complete the documentation refactoring project.

## What We've Done

### 1. Structure and Organization

- Reorganized the documentation into a clear, navigable structure with distinct sections for guides and examples
- Standardized the example structure to have a consistent pattern (demo/visualization at the top, explanation below)
- Updated navigation in `astro.config.mjs` to reflect the new organization
- Created a distinction between basic and advanced examples for progressive learning

### 2. TypeScript Integration

- Improved TypeScript integration by separating actual code examples into `.ts` files that are imported via `?raw` into docs
- Fixed Twoslash usage to be explicit via a `twoslash` prop, rather than automatic for all code blocks
- Created proper example files for the matchbox functionality with type checking
- Ensured all code examples are real, runnable code that reflects the actual library API

### 3. Visual Components

- Created `MachineExampleWithChart` and `DemoWithMermaid` components for standardized, interactive examples
- Improved visual presentation of examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Added state diagrams to visualize state machines in relevant examples

### 4. Content Improvements

- Fixed terminology issues, particularly around the MatchboxFactory API
- Created focused, minimal examples that demonstrate one concept at a time
- Updated the matchbox documentation to properly reflect its role in the library
- Ensured all examples are type-checked and work correctly

## How We're Doing It

Our approach to documentation follows these principles:

1. **Code First**: All code examples are real TypeScript files that are typechecked and can be executed
2. **Import, Don't Freehand**: Code examples are imported from actual files using `?raw` rather than written directly in MDX
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple examples first, then build up to more complex ones
4. **Visual Learning**: Use diagrams, state charts, and interactive demos where helpful
5. **Explicit Twoslash**: Only use Twoslash where type inference needs to be demonstrated
6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming, structure, and organization across docs

## What Remains

### 2. Navigation Updates

- Update navigation in `astro.config.mjs` to include a link to the new `/guides/matchbox` page (currently it only has `/guides/union-machines`)
- Consider renaming "Matchbox (Tagged Unions)" to just "MatchboxFactory" in the navigation for consistency

### 3. Content Gaps

- Complete documentation for remaining guides that may be missing or incomplete
- Ensure all examples have proper MDX pages with explanations
- Add more explanation of TypeScript inference capabilities where appropriate
- Review and update the index page to ensure it properly introduces the library

### 4. Cross-Referencing

- Add cross-references between related guides and examples
- Ensure terminology is consistent across all documentation
- Link to relevant examples from guide pages

### 5. Advanced Usage

- Add more advanced examples showing composition of different features
- Document edge cases and advanced patterns
- Include troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Outstanding Issues

1. **MatchboxFactory Documentation**: We've updated the terminology, but we should verify if the `/guides/matchbox` page needs to be linked in the navigation instead of or in addition to `/guides/union-machines`.

2. **Duplicate Content**: There may be overlap between guides that should be consolidated.

3. **Code Example Consistency**: We should audit all code examples to ensure they follow the same patterns and conventions.

## Next Steps

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` to include links to all documentation pages
2. Review each guide for completeness and consistency
3. Add any missing cross-references between related content

By addressing these items, we'll complete the documentation refactoring project and provide a high-quality, consistent, and helpful set of documentation for Matchina users.

# Documentation Analysis: Examples and Structure

Let me review the examples, identify patterns, and analyze their structure to help streamline the documentation.

## Examples Analysis Grid

Searched for files matching `**/examples/*.mdx`, 19 matches

Let me examine some examples to understand their structure and identify patterns:

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Visualization**: Some examples use [MachineExampleWithChart](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html), others use custom components, and some have no visualization at all.
2. **Redundant Code**: Many examples show the "Full Code" section after already showing individual snippets, creating duplication.
3. **Too Many Stopwatch Variants**: There are at least 5 different stopwatch examples showing slight variations that could be consolidated.
4. **Inconsistent API Usage**: Some examples use [facade](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html), others use [createMachine](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) + [zen](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html), and others use `matchina` directly.
5. **Verbose Explanations**: Many examples have lengthy explanations that repeat concepts already covered in the guides.
6. **Missing Diagrams**: Several complex examples (Auth Flow, Checkout) would benefit from state diagrams but don't have them.

## Recommendations for Each Example Type

### Basic Examples (Toggle, Counter, Traffic Light)

* Use consistent visualization with [MachineExampleWithChart](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)
* Focus on a single concept per example
* Limit explanation to 2-3 key points
* Remove redundant "Full Code" sections

### Intermediate Examples (Fetch, Auth Flow)

* Add visualizations to all examples
* Standardize on either [facade](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) or [createMachine](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) + [zen](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) pattern
* Focus on the unique aspects of each example
* Use tabs to separate concerns rather than linear explanation

### Advanced Examples (Stopwatch variants, Checkout)

* Consolidate redundant examples (especially stopwatches)
* Create a single "Stopwatch" with tabs for different implementation approaches
* Add visualizations to complex examples
* Use comparison tables instead of verbose explanations

## Teaching Strategy for Concepts

1. **State Machines**: Start with visual diagram → show state definition → show transitions → demonstrate usage (in that order)
2. **Pattern Matching**: Show problem statement → demonstrate match syntax → show alternative approaches → explain type safety
3. **Lifecycle & Hooks**: Show simple "before/after" examples → demonstrate hook API → show real-world use case
4. **Promise Handling**: Show problem statement → demonstrate promise state machine → show error handling → show integration

By following these approaches, we can significantly reduce the documentation length while making it more effective for learning.
