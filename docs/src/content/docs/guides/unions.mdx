title: Tagged Unions
description: "A powerful typed factory for creating tagged ## Conclusion

The `matchboxFactory` provides a powerful way to work with tagged unions in TypeScript, offering better type safety, pattern matching, and developer experience than using plain TypeScript discriminated unions.

The key advantages are:
- Factory functions for creating properly typed tagged union instances
- Exhaustive pattern matching
- Built-in type guards and assertions
- Excellent type inference

This makes complex state modeling and data handling more robust and maintainable, with TypeScript helping to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.ypeScript"

The `matchboxFactory` function creates factories for working with tagged unions in TypeScript, providing type-safe pattern matching, exhaustiveness checking, and comprehensive type inference.

## What are Tagged Unions?

Tagged unions (also known as discriminated unions or sum types) are a powerful way to represent data that can be one of several distinct types, each with its own structure:

<CodeBlock code={tsNativeUnionRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />
