The `matchboxFactory` function creates factories for working with tagged unions in TypeScript, providing type-safe pattern matching, exhaustiveness checking, and comprehensive type inference.

## What are Tagged Unions?

Tagged unions (also known as discriminated unions or sum types) are a powerful way to represent data that can be one of several distinct types, each with its own structure:

<CodeBlock code={tsNativeUnionRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Why MatchboxFactory?

While TypeScript has built-in support for discriminated unions, the `matchboxFactory` system adds powerful capabilities:

1. **Factory Functions** - Create tagged union instances with proper typing
2. **Pattern Matching** - Match against union variants with exhaustiveness checking
3. **Type Predicates** - Built-in type guards with the `is` method
4. **Type Assertion** - Convert between variants with the `as` method
5. **Complete Type Inference** - Full inference with minimal type annotations

## Creating a Factory

You can create a factory using the `matchboxFactory` function. This factory then provides functions to create individual tagged union instances:

<CodeBlock code={lightBasicRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Pattern Matching

The most powerful feature of tagged unions created with `matchboxFactory` is exhaustive pattern matching with the `match` method:

<CodeBlock code={lightPatternMatchingRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Type Guards

Tagged union instances created with `matchboxFactory` provide automatic type narrowing with the `is` method:

<CodeBlock code={lightTypeGuardsRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Using Default Cases

Sometimes you want to handle multiple states with a single case, or provide a fallback:

<CodeBlock code={lightDefaultCaseRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Non-Exhaustive Matching

You can opt-out of exhaustiveness checking by passing `false` as the second argument:

<CodeBlock code={nonExhaustiveRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Type Casting

Use the `as` method for type-safe casting with runtime validation:

<CodeBlock code={lightCastingRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Custom Tag Property

By default, the tag property is named `tag`, but you can customize it:

<CodeBlock code={lightCustomTagRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Advanced Pattern Matching

Tagged unions created with `matchboxFactory` can handle complex scenarios with nested data:

<CodeBlock code={lightAdvancedMatchingRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />

## Conclusion

Matchbox provides a powerful way to work with tagged unions in TypeScript, offering better type safety, pattern matching, and developer experience than plain TypeScript discriminated unions.

The key advantages are:
- Factory functions for creating properly typed variants
- Exhaustive pattern matching
- Built-in type guards and assertions
- Excellent type inference

This makes complex state modeling and data handling more robust and maintainable, with TypeScript helping to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.
