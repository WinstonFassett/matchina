{/* ## What are Tagged Unions? */}

Tagged unions (also known as discriminated unions or sum types) are a powerful way to represent data that can be one of several distinct types, each with its own structure:

<CodeBlock code={tsNativeUnionRaw} lang="ts" twoslash={true} />


This makes complex state modeling and data handling more robust and maintainable, with TypeScript helping to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.


## Tagged Unions in Matchina

Create tagged unions using `matchboxFactory` to define unions of any type, or using `defineStates` to create states for use with [state machines](/matchina/guides/state-machine-interface).
