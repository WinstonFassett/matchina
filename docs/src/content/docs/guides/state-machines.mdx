## What is a state machine?

{/* At the heart of Matchina is a well-defined state machine interface that governs how state transitions occur and how events flow through the system. */}

A minimal (pure) state machine in Matchina looks like this:

```ts
const { getState, send } = createMachine(states, transitions, initialState);
```

## Core Interfaces

In addition to `getState` and `send`, machines internally include several lifecycle methods and hook support for more advanced control.

Here are the core interfaces that define a Matchina state machine:

<CodeBlock code={stateMachineCode} lang="ts" />

If you prefer to only expose a minimal interface to consumers, you can use the `pure` API wrapper:

```ts
import { pure } from "matchina";
// a pure state machine interface with ONLY getState and send
const { getState, send } = pure(
  createMachine(states, transitions, initialState)
);
```
