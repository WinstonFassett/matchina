## Advanced Pattern: State Change Subscriptions

For observing state changes without affecting them, you can use `subscribe`:

```ts
// Subscribe to all state changes
const unsubscribe = counter.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log(`State changed to: ${state.key}`);

  if (state.is("Counting")) {
    console.log(`Current count: ${state.data.count}`);
  }
});

// Later, when no longer needed:
unsubscribe();
```
