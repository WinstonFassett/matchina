## State Machine Lifecycle

When a state transition occurs, the following lifecycle hooks are called in order:

1. **resolve** - Maps event to a transition, determining the target state
2. **guard** - Determines if the transition is allowed to proceed
3. **handle** - First opportunity to handle the event (can cancel by returning undefined)
4. **before** - Called before the state change (can cancel by returning undefined)
5. **update** - Updates the internal state reference
6. **effect** - Perform side effects during the transition
7. **leave** - Called when leaving the current state
8. **enter** - Called when entering the new state
9. **notify** - Notifies subscribers of the state change
10. **after** - Final hook, called after the transition completes
