## Lifecycle
Every event sent to the machine goes through the following phases: 
  - `resolve`
  - `transition`
    - `guard`
    - `handle`
    - `before`
    - `update`
    - `effect`
      - `leave`
      - `enter`
    - `notify`
    - `after`

Is this overkill? Probably. The main ones to use are `guard` and `effect`.

`leave` and `enter` are useful to ensure that such transition effects do not interfere with one another. All `leave` handlers run before any `enter`  handlers.
