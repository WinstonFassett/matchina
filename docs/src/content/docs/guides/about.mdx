## What is Matchina?

Matchina is a lightweight toolkit for building type-safe state machinery. 

<Aside>
  Matchina is an exploratory library. 

  It has tests and demos but is not yet stable or production-tested.
</Aside>

{/* It provides:

- **Strongly-typed store and state machines** with full type inference
- **Tagged unions** via the `matchbox` pattern for discriminated types
- **Type-safe transitions** with smart parameter inference
- **Promise integration** for handling async operations safely
- **Nano-sized, opt-in primitives** for state machines and async logic
- **Composable APIs** that work together or standalone */}

## Why Matchina?

{/* - **Lightweight**: Each feature is just a few hundred bytes */}
- **Composable**: Use only what you need
- **TypeScript-First**: Full type inference and safety
- **Extensible**: composable setup, enhancers, lifecycle hooks
- **No Dependencies**: Zero runtime dependencies
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any UI library
{/* - **Matching**: switch and filter matching, union factories */}
{/* - **React Integration**: First-class support for React */}


## What's inside

- **State Machines**: state machine, promise machine
- **Matchbox Union Factories**: matchbox, matchbox-factory
- **Integrations**: React, Zod, Valibot
- **Extras**: when, delay, effects, subscribe, reset
