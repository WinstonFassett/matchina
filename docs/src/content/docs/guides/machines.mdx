The Finite State Machine (FSM) pattern is:

```ts 
  const {(getState, send)} = fsm(states, transitions, initialState) 
```

### States

States can be any type, usually extending `string` or `object`.

Factory Machines use state factory functions to create keyed state objects.

###### `defineStates`

Use `defineStates` to create a fully-typed state factory.

```ts
const states = defineStates({
  Idle: null,
  Fetching: (userId: string) => ({ userId }),
  Succeeded: (result: User) => ({ result }),
  Failed: (error: Error) => ({ error }),
});
```

###### `key` and `data`

```ts
const state = states.Fetching("user-id");
state.key === "Fetching";
state.data.userId === "user-id";
```

###### `match`

```ts
console.log(
  state.match({
    Idle: () => "idle",
    Fetching: ({ userId }) => `fetching ${userId}`,
    Succeeded: ({ result }) => `succeeded ${result}`,
    Failed: ({ error }) => `failed ${error}`,
  }),
);
```

### Transitions

Transitions are keyed by state `key` and transition `type`.

From the `state-machine` resolve function:

```ts
const to = machine.transitions[ev.from.key][ev.type];
```

Transition configuration varies by machine type.

- Basic state machine `transitions` will be used as the next state
- Factory machines `transitions` can be string state keys or functions that return the next state
- Promise machines `transitions` are already provided

## Factory Machines

Create a factory machine with

```ts
createFactoryMachine(states, transitions, initialState);
```

### Factory Machine States

Define states first with `defineStates` or create inline by passing in creator map.

With inline states factory:

```ts
const machine = createFactoryMachine(
  {
    Idle: undefined,
    Foo: (foo: string) => ({ foo }),
    Bar: (bar: number) => ({ bar }),
  },
  transitions,
  "Idle",
);
```

With standalone states factory:

```ts
const states = defineStates( {
  Idle: undefined,
  Foo: (foo: string) => ({ foo }),
  Bar: (bar: number) => ({ bar })
})
const machine = createFactoryMachine(
  states,
  transitions,
  states.Foo(...)
)
```

### Factory Machine Transitions

Factory Machine Transition values can be:

- a Factory State `key`
- a function returning a Factory State
- a function returning a Resolver

A simple transition function:

```ts
(...myParameters: any[]) => MyExitState;
```

A transition resolver function:

```ts
(...myParameters: any[]) =>
  ({ type, from }) =>
    MyExitState;
```

For example, in the snippet below:

- `toggle` uses a simple state `key`
- `foo` takes a parameter and returns a Factory State
- `increment` takes a `bar` parameter and returns a Resolver that increments `ev.from.data.bar` by that amount

```ts
const machine = createFactoryMachine(
  states,
  {
    Idle: {
      toggle: "Foo",
    },
    Foo: {
      toggle: "Bar",
      foo: (foo = "foo") => states.Foo(`my-${foo}`),
    },
    Bar: {
      toggle: "Foo",
      increment: (bar: number) => (ev) => states.Bar(ev.from.data.bar + bar),
    },
  },
  "Idle",
);
```

## Promise Machines

<PromiseMachineDiagram />

Matchina provides a convenient way to work with promises and state machines using `createPromiseMachine`.
Its states are: `Idle`, `Pending`(`promise` and `params`), `Resolved` (`result`), and Rejected (`error`).

To execute the promise machine when in an `Idle` state, use the `execute` method.
This will transition the machine to the `Pending` state and return a promise that resolves to the `result` or rejects with an `error`.

### State Payloads

- The Pending state includes the original `params` and provides a `promise` property that can be awaited directly.
- The Resolved state includes the `result` of the promise.
- The Rejected state includes the `error` that occurred during the promise execution.
