## State Machine Concept

At the heart of Matchina is a well-defined state machine interface that governs how state transitions occur and how events flow through the system.

## States

Matchina supports two approaches to working with states:

### Primitive States

The simplest form of state is a primitive key-value representation:

```ts
interface State {
  key: string;
}
```

While this primitive state model is supported, it offers limited type safety and requires manual type assertions when working with state data.

### State Factories

The real power of Matchina comes from **state factories** created with `matchboxFactory` or `defineStates`. These enable:

- Type-safe state creation with proper parameter inference
- Exhaustive pattern matching
- Built-in type guards
- Rich state data with full TypeScript inference

State factories are the recommended approach for most applications, as they provide a much better developer experience and stronger type safety.

## Core Interfaces

The following interfaces define the fundamental state machine architecture in Matchina:

<CodeBlock code={stateMachineCode} lang="ts" />

## State Machine Lifecycle

When a state transition occurs, the following lifecycle hooks are called in order:

1. **resolve** - Maps event to a transition, determining the target state
2. **guard** - Determines if the transition is allowed to proceed
3. **handle** - First opportunity to handle the event (can cancel by returning undefined)
4. **before** - Called before the state change (can cancel by returning undefined)
5. **update** - Updates the internal state reference
6. **effect** - Perform side effects during the transition
7. **leave** - Called when leaving the current state
8. **enter** - Called when entering the new state
9. **notify** - Notifies subscribers of the state change
10. **after** - Final hook, called after the transition completes
