## What is a state machine?

{/* At the heart of Matchina is a well-defined state machine interface that governs how state transitions occur and how events flow through the system. */}

A minimal (pure) state machine in Matchina looks like this:

```ts
const { getState, send } = createMachine(states, transitions, initialState);
```

## How to Create a State Machine

After first defining your states (i.e. by using `defineStates` or `matchboxFactory`), you can create a state machine using the `createMachine` for a minimal factory machine, or `matchina` for a machine wrapped with `assignEventApi`, giving it a convenience API for firing events.
