## What is a state machine?

{/* At the heart of Matchina is a well-defined state machine interface that governs how state transitions occur and how events flow through the system. */}

A minimal (pure) state machine in Matchina looks like this:

```ts
const { getState, send } = createMachine(states, transitions, initialState);
```
