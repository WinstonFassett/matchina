{/* Matchina is a TypeScript library for building type-safe state machines with clear transition definitions. It provides:

- **Type-safe state transitions**: Define exactly which state can transition to which other states
- **State-specific data**: Each state can have its own typed data structure
- **Simple API**: Create and interact with state machines through a clean, intuitive API
- **TypeScript integration**: Full type safety and
  IDE autocompletion */}

## Installation

<Installation />

## Interactive Example: Traffic Light

Here's a simple traffic light state machine that demonstrates Matchina's core concepts:

<div className="not-content">
  <TrafficLightExample client:only="react" />
</div>

## Source Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode },
    { name: "TrafficLightView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]}
/>

For a detailed walkthrough and explanation, see the [Traffic Light Example](/matchina/examples/traffic-light).

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **State Definition**: Define states with typed data using `defineStates()`
- **Machine Creation**: Create a state machine with `matchina()` by specifying states, transitions, and initial state
- **Transition Definition**: Define allowed state transitions as a simple object structure
- **React Integration**: Integrate state machines in React components with `useMachine()`
