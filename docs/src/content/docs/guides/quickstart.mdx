Matchina is a TypeScript library for building type-safe state machines with clear transition definitions. It provides:

- **Type-safe state transitions**: Define exactly which state can transition to which other states
- **State-specific data**: Each state can have its own typed data structure
- **Simple API**: Create and interact with state machines through a clean, intuitive API
- **TypeScript integration**: Full type safety and IDE autocompletion

## Installation

```sh
npm install matchina
```

## Interactive Example: Traffic Light

Here's a simple traffic light state machine that demonstrates Matchina's core concepts:

<div className="not-content">
  <TrafficLightExample client:only="react" />
</div>

## Source Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode },
    { name: "TrafficLightView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]}
/>

## How This Example Works

This traffic light example demonstrates the core components of a Matchina state machine:

1. **State Definition**: We define three states (`Red`, `Yellow`, `Green`), each with associated data (a message).
   ```ts
   const states = defineStates({
     Green: () => ({ message: "Go" }),
     Yellow: () => ({ message: "Prepare to stop" }),
     Red: () => ({ message: "Stop" }),
   });
   ```

2. **Machine Creation**: The state machine is created using `matchina()`, which takes:
   - The defined states
   - A transition map describing allowed state changes (using the `next` event)
   - An initial state (`"Red"`)
   ```ts
   return matchina(
     states,
     {
       Green: { next: "Yellow" },
       Yellow: { next: "Red" },
       Red: { next: "Green" },
     },
     "Red",
   );
   ```

3. **State Transitions**: The machine cycles through states when `machine.next()` is called.

4. **State Access**: The current state is accessed using `machine.getState()`, which provides:
   - The state key (`currentState.key`)
   - Type-safe access to state data (`currentState.data.message`)
   - Methods for state checking (`currentState.is("Red")`)

5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout, preventing invalid state references.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **State Definition**: Define states with typed data using `defineStates()`
- **Machine Creation**: Create a state machine with `matchina()` by specifying states, transitions, and initial state
- **Transition Definition**: Define allowed state transitions as a simple object structure
- **React Integration**: Integrate state machines in React components with `useMachine()`
