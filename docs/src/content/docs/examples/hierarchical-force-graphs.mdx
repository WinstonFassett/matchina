# Hierarchical Force-Directed Graph Experiments

*Internal experiments for exploring hierarchical force-directed graphs with container shapes for state machine visualization.*

## Experiment 1: Custom Force Simulation + Convex Hull Containers

### Overview
Custom force simulation with convex hull calculation to create smooth organic container shapes around compound states.

### Test: Traffic Light HSM
<div className="not-content">
  <TrafficLightHierarchicalView client:only="react" />
</div>

### Results
- ✅ Smooth organic container shapes
- ✅ Real-time updates as nodes move
- ✅ Interactive drag-and-drop
- ✅ Zero external dependencies
- ✅ Lightweight custom implementation

## Experiment 2: WebCola Constraint-Based Layout

### Overview
WebCola provides constraint-based layout with automatic group bounds calculation and overlap avoidance.

### Test: Traffic Light HSM
<div className="not-content">
  <TrafficLightWebColaView client:only="react" />
</div>

### Results
- ✅ Automatic group bounds calculation
- ✅ Built-in overlap avoidance
- ✅ Constraint-based positioning
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ⚠️ External dependency (~15KB)

## Experiment 3: G6 Graph Visualization Library

### Overview
G6 is a powerful graph visualization library with excellent support for hierarchical layouts, subgraphs, and advanced styling.

### Test: Traffic Light HSM
<div className="not-content">
  <TrafficLightG6Example client:only="react" />
</div>

### Results
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Setting up G6 integration
- ✅ Professional graph visualization library
- ✅ Multiple layout algorithms (dagre, force, circular)
- ✅ Rich interactive behaviors
- ✅ Advanced styling options
- ✅ Subgraph/combo support
- ⚠️ Larger dependency (~96KB)
- ⚠️ TypeScript compilation issues to resolve

## Technical Notes

### Custom Implementation Benefits
- **No external dependencies** - built from scratch
- **Complete control** over force simulation
- **Optimized for state machines** - only needed features
- **Lightweight** - much smaller than existing force-graph libraries

### Container Shape Algorithm
- **Graham scan convex hull** for organic shapes
- **Rectangle fallback** for 2-node groups
- **Real-time updates** as force simulation runs
