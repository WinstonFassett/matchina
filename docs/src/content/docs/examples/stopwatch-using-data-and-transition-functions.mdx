## Interactive Stopwatch Example

<div className="not-content">
  <StopwatchExample client:visible />
</div>

## About This Example

This example demonstrates a function-oriented approach to state machine implementation. It showcases:

- Using state `data` for tracking `elapsed` time without React state
- Function-based state transitions for rich TypeScript type inference
- Separation of machine logic and UI components

This approach is more verbose but provides stronger typing and clearer data flow between states.

## Machine Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode },
    { name: "StopwatchView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
    { name: "../lib/tick-effect.ts", code: tickEffectCode },
  ]}
/>
