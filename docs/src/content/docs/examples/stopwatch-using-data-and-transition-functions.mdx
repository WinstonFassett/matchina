title: Stopwatch React with data and transition parameters
---

import { Stopwatch } from "@code/examples/stopwatch-using-data-and-transition-functions";
import code from "@code/examples/Stopwatch-using-data-and-transition-functions.tsx?raw";
import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.astro";

<div className="text-4xl text-red-500 text-green-500 text-yellow-500 w-full p-4 flex-1 flex items-center gap-2 rounded"></div>

<div className="not-content">
  <Stopwatch client:visible />
</div>

This is a function-oriented example. It is the opposite of declarative.

It also uses state `data` for tracking `elapsed` time and does not rely on React `useMemo` or `useState` for state or effects.

It is a bit more verbose, but it shows the power of using functions for state data and transition handlers.

If you're into that sort of thing. I am.

But admittedly, it's not as pretty, and a little harder to follow.

This example shows how we can use functions for a richer typescript experience.
