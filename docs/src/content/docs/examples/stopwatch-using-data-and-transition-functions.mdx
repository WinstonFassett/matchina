## Interactive Stopwatch Example

<div className="not-content">
  <StopwatchExample client:visible />
</div>

## About This Example

This example demonstrates a function-oriented approach to state machine implementation. It showcases:

- Using state `data` for tracking `elapsed` time without React state
- Function-based state transitions for rich TypeScript type inference
- Separation of machine logic and UI components

This approach is more verbose but provides stronger typing and clearer data flow between states.

## Machine Code

The machine implementation defines state data constructors and transitions as functions:

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" code={machineCode} />

## Component Integration

Here's how the stopwatch machine is integrated with React:

<CodeBlock lang="jsx" code={indexCode} />
