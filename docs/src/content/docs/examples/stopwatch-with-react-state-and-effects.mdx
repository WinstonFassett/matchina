import { Stopwatch } from '@lib/examples/Stopwatch-with-react-state-and-effects.tsx'
import code from '@lib/examples/Stopwatch-with-react-state-and-effects.tsx?raw'
import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.astro";

<div className="text-4xl text-red-500 text-green-500 text-yellow-500 w-full"></div>

<div className="not-content">
  <Stopwatch client:visible />
</div>

This is a React-first implementation using a declarative state machine. 

Nothing fancy here. Longer than the rest, but not by much.

The `useStopwatch` hook relies on React for its state and effects.
