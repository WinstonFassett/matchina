## Interactive Stopwatch Example

<div className="not-content">
  <StopwatchExample client:only="react" />
</div>

## About This Example

This version demonstrates using `transitionHooks` instead of `useEffect`:
- Uses transition hooks to manage side effects
- Provides better TypeScript autocompletion support
- Constrains event types to their specific states

## Machine Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode },
    { name: "useStopwatch.ts", code: hookCode },
    { name: "StopwatchView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]}
/>
