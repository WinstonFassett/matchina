title: ReactFlow Subflow Test
description: Exact ReactFlow subflow example from reactflow.dev
---

import ExactReactFlowSubflow from "../../../../../ExactReactFlowSubflow";
import CodeTabs from "@components/CodeTabs.astro";
import subflowCode from "../../../../../ExactReactFlowSubflow.tsx?raw";

This is the **exact unadulterated ReactFlow subflow example** from https://reactflow.dev/examples/grouping/sub-flows

<div className="not-content">
  <ExactReactFlowSubflow client:only="react" />
</div>

## What to Look For:

- **Group A** - Contains "Node A.1" as a child
- **Group B** - Contains "Node B.1" with `extent: 'parent'` constraint
- **Group B.A** - Nested group inside Group B with "Node B.A.1" and "Node B.A.2"
- **Hierarchical structure** - Parent-child relationships with visual containment

## Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "ExactReactFlowSubflow.tsx", code: subflowCode },
  ]}
/>
