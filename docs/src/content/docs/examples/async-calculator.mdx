## About This Example

This example demonstrates a basic promise machine for handling asynchronous calculations:

- Defines a promise machine with Idle, Pending, Resolved, and Rejected states
- Manages async operation lifecycle automatically
- Provides type-safe event parameters and state payloads
- Shows how promise machines handle success and error cases

The promise machine pattern is perfect for any asynchronous operation - from simple calculations to complex API workflows.
