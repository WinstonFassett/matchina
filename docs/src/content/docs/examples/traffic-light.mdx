A traffic light state machine that cycles through Red, Yellow, and Green states, demonstrating a state machine with multiple distinct states in a defined sequence.

## Implementation Details

This example demonstrates:

- Creating a machine with multiple distinct states (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Cyclical transitions between states in a defined sequence
- Using the `withApi` helper to create a clean API for transitions
- Leveraging pattern matching with `state.match()` for UI rendering

Unlike the counter example which used data within a state, or the toggle example with just two states, this traffic light example shows how to model a system with a clear sequence of states.

## Machine Code

<CodeTabs files={[
  { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode, twoslash: true },
  { name: "TrafficLightView.tsx", code: viewCode },
  { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]} />

## Additional Notes

- Each state (Red, Yellow, Green) represents a discrete condition of the traffic light
- The `next` transition allows cycling through the states in the proper sequence
- The view component uses `state.match()` to elegantly handle different UI states
- Pattern matching is type-safe and ensures all states are handled

## Extensions

This basic implementation can be extended in several ways:

- Add automatic transitions using lifecycle hooks and timers
- Implement pedestrian crossing controls
- Add special states like "flashing yellow" for low-traffic periods

Check out the [Extended Traffic Light Example](/examples/traffic-light-extended) to see the first two extensions implemented (automatic transitions and pedestrian crossing).

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen state machines with varying complexity, you might want to explore:

- [Advanced State Data](/guides/state-data) - Learn more about storing and using data in states
- [Lifecycle Hooks](/guides/lifecycle) - Add behavior when states change
- [State Guards](/guides/guards) - Control when transitions can occur
