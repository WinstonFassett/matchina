title: Stopwatch with React State and Effects

import StopwatchExample from "@code/examples/stopwatch-using-react-state-and-effects";
import indexCode from "@code/examples/stopwatch-using-react-state-and-effects/index.tsx?raw";
import hookCode from "@code/examples/stopwatch-using-react-state-and-effects/useStopwatch.ts?raw";
import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.astro";

## Interactive Stopwatch Example

<div className="not-content">
  <StopwatchExample client:visible />
</div>

## About This Example

This example demonstrates a React-first implementation using a declarative state machine:

- Uses React's native state management and effects
- Encapsulates all state machine logic in a custom hook
- Simple, idiomatic React code with clear patterns

The `useStopwatch` hook relies on React for both its state management and effects, making it familiar to React developers.

## Hook Implementation

<CodeBlock lang="typescript" code={hookCode} />

## Component Integration

<CodeBlock lang="jsx" code={indexCode} />
