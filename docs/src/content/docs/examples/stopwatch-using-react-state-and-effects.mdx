## Interactive Stopwatch Example

<div className="not-content">
  <StopwatchExample client:visible />
</div>

## About This Example

This example demonstrates a React-first implementation using a declarative state machine:

- Uses React's native state management and effects
- Encapsulates all state machine logic in a custom hook
- Simple, idiomatic React code with clear patterns

The `useStopwatch` hook relies on React for both its state management and effects, making it familiar to React developers.

## Machine Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "useStopwatch.ts", code: hookCode },
    { name: "StopwatchView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]}
/>
