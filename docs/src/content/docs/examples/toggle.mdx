description: A basic on/off toggle state machine example

import ToggleExample from "@code/examples/toggle/example";
import machineCode from "@code/examples/toggle/machine.ts?raw";
import viewCode from "@code/examples/toggle/ToggleView.tsx?raw";
import indexCode from "@code/examples/toggle/index.tsx?raw";

import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.astro";
import CodeTabs from "@components/CodeTabs.astro";

A simple toggle state machine that switches between `On` and `Off` states, demonstrating the most basic state machine pattern with two states and direct transitions between them.

<div className="not-content">
  <ToggleExample client:only="react" />
</div>

## Implementation Details

This example demonstrates the core concepts of state machines in Matchina:

- Two simple states (`On` and `Off`) with no additional data
- Direct transitions between states using string references
- Using the `withApi` helper to create a clean API for transitions

Unlike the counter example which used a single state with data, this toggle example uses two distinct states to represent the On and Off conditions.

## Machine Code

<CodeTabs
  files={[
    { name: "machine.ts", code: machineCode },
    { name: "ToggleView.tsx", code: viewCode },
    { name: "index.tsx", code: indexCode },
  ]}
/>

## Additional Notes

- The toggle uses direct state transitions (changing from one state to another)
- The UI updates based on the current state
- This pattern is useful for modeling components with distinct behavioral modes

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen a basic toggle machine, you might want to explore:

- [Counter Example](/examples/counter) - Add numeric data to your states
- [Traffic Light Example](/examples/traffic-light) - Create a machine with more states
- [Lifecycle Hooks](/guides/lifecycle) - Add behavior when states change
